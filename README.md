## Running the sample in the dev container

This project includes a `.devcontainer` folder with a [dev container configuration](https://containers.dev/), which lets you use a container as a full-featured dev environment.

You can use the dev container to build and run the app without needing to install any of its tools locally! You can work in GitHub Codespaces or the VS Code Dev Containers extension.

Learn more about using the dev container in its [readme](/.devcontainer/devcontainerreadme.md).
